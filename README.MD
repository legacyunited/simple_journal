#Simple Journal

A very simple web interface for notes and journal entries. Allows for writing and reading journal posts, can display by tag or order of creation. Also allows you to edit or delete existing journal entires. Is NOT even remotely secure--do not use in a production enviornment.

This is an app I created "accidentally"--I installed PHP on my local server and was just having fun writing some simple scripts. Halfway through, I suddenly realized I had half the components needed to read from my journal/note-taking textfiles, which is something I meant to get around to eventually. There is no particular distinction between backend and frontend, no security, and certainly no seperation of MVC. It's a really great example of how NOT to write an app--and is a fine illustration of how easy it is write bad code in PHP. (That all said, it works fine for its intended purpose, as offensive as it may be for an experienced developer.)

Utilizes PHP, HTML, and CSS.
